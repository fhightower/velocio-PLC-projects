# Programmable Logic Controller Projects

This project includes files for a square calculator (which outputs the square of the given input) and two variations of a program which will output the current second.

All of these projects are designed for Velocio's ACE PLC (http://velocio.net/ace/) and can be edited in Velocio's [vBuilder](http://velocio.net/vbuilder/) software.
